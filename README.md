# PyHub: how to use?
To use Pyhub, you need to go into your terminal/shell and write: ```pip install requests```, ```pip install rich``` and ```pip install groq```. 
After that, look for this text “YOUR_API_KEY_HERE” and replace it with your API keys. This code only uses the groq API and the pexels API, see the pexels API and the Groq console:
